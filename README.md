# Smart Lighting System                                                  
IoT and smart lighting revolutionize illumination with real-time, adaptive controls, enhancing comfort and energy efficiency while enabling intelligent, sustainable environments which works according to the situations of light and object.

## Sensors Used
- `UltraSonic HC-SR-4 sensor` - Measures the distance between the sensor and object.
- `LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)` - Checks the intensity of the light.

## Libraries Used
Unified Sensor by Adafruit
