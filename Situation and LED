SITUATION 1: 
Daylight and Object Detected-> In this case, the UltrasonicSensor and LDR Sensor both identify an object or person as being there. 
The LED(s) continue to be off as a result, showing that no extra lighting is required.

SITUATION 2:
Dark and No Object-> When it gets dark (LDR senses low light) but the ultrasonic sensor doesn't pick up any objects or people, 
the LED(s) don't turn on because there is no one to light up for.

SITUATION 3:
Dark and Object Present-> The Arduino activates the LED(s) to offer additional brightness, improving visibility in the dark area, 
when it is dark (LDR detects low light) and the Ultrasonic Sensor detects an object or person.
